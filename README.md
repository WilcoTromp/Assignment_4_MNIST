# To implement this code you need to use a python nodebook environment
```
This program was developed in VS Code
It uses the conda base environment
but copying this code to google colab should not present with any problems.
the only thing that would need change is the path to the best model
to do this you would need to run the training module, and then copy the path
from the files section on the left and replace the path in the evaluation module
```
